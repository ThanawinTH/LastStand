# Last Stand

## Space Dungeon Tower Defense

- **Game Genre:** Tower Defense, Strategy
- **Engine:** Python + Pygame-CE

Last Stand is a top-down grid-based tower defense game set in a space dungeon. You strategically place and upgrade towers to defend your base from waves of enemies moving along a fixed path. Each session tracks your performance — kills, towers placed, gold spent on upgrades, and lives lost — and stores it in a CSV that feeds a live analytics dashboard.

The game also ships with a standalone **Statistics Dashboard** (customtkinter + matplotlib) where you can review your performance across all sessions with charts and summary statistics.

### How to Play

1. Launch the game and click **Play** on the start screen
2. Select a tower type using keys `1`, `2`, or `3`
3. Click on any highlighted **build tile** on the map to place it
4. Enemies spawn from the top and follow the path toward your base
5. Towers attack enemies automatically when they enter range
6. Earn gold from kills — use it to place or upgrade more towers
7. Survive all **10 waves** to win; lose all lives and it's game over

### Tips

- Ballista Towers pierce through multiple enemies — great on long straight paths
- Upgrade early towers to maximize gold efficiency
- Use Mage Towers behind Archer Towers for high-damage support
- Check the Statistics Dashboard after your sessions to spot patterns in your play style
